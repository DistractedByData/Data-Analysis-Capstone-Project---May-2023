As part of my journey on the [data analysis career path](https://join.codecademy.com/learn/paths/data-analyst-b/), I undertook a final independent project, focusing on an area of great interest to me - the National Hockey League (NHL). The aim of this project was to perform a comprehensive analysis of every shot taken during the 2022-23 regular season.

The freedom to select my own research topic, formulate the research questions, and devise my analytical approach was immensely gratifying. With no limitations apart from available data, I discovered a rich dataset containing extensive details about all shots fired during this NHL regular season. The dataset offered 137 distinct features, including the shooters name, outcome (goal or no goal), shot location, shot type, and the duration of the shift when the shot was taken, among many others.

After a thorough review of the dataset and a reconsideration of my objectives, I decided to approach this analysis from a coaching standpoint with an aim to enhance a team's scoring capabilities. Consequently, I narrowed down my research focus to the following five key questions:

    1. What constitutes a high scoring percentage in the NHL? How does the scoring percentage vary by position?
    2. Which are the most commonly used shot types by players? Does any particular shot type result in more goals than others?
    3. At what point during a player's shift do they typically score?
    4. During which game period - first, second, or third - do most goals occur?
    5. Where on the rink do most shots take place? Which locations result in the most goals?

Answering these questions by applying statistical methods has enabled me to propose ways coaches could enhance their offensive strategies. For instance, specific shot types have demonstrated a higher probability of success, although this varies by position - this insight could prompt coaches to place additional emphasis on shot training, thereby optimizing their team's scoring capabilities.
